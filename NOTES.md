# ExpenseTracker Development Notes

## Project Overview
A comprehensive Phoenix LiveView expense tracking application built for budget management and expense categorization.

## Technology Stack
- **Phoenix Framework** with LiveView for real-time UI updates
- **Elixir** as the primary language
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Ecto** for database interactions and schema management
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **CLDR** for proper currency formatting

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Categories** table with monthly budget tracking in cents
- **Expenses** table linked to categories via foreign key
- All monetary values stored as integers (cents) to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Date validation to prevent future expenses

### LiveView Implementation
- Separate LiveViews for category management and dashboard
- Phoenix Streams for efficient list rendering with `phx-update="stream"`
- Modal components for create/edit operations
- Real-time budget calculations and progress tracking

### Money Handling
- CLDR implementation for proper currency formatting
- Validation limits: 1 cent minimum, $100,000 maximum per expense
- Budget percentage calculations with proper rounding

### UI/UX Features
- Gradient-based design with purple/blue color scheme
- Responsive grid layouts for different screen sizes
- Interactive JavaScript hooks for animations:
  - `CounterAnimation` for budget amounts
  - `TooltipHover` for contextual information
  - `ProgressAnimation` for budget progress bars
- Custom input styling with focus states and disabled button handling

## Key Implementation Details

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation using Phoenix changesets
- Real-time validation feedback with `phx-change` events
- Button disabling when forms are invalid
- Future date prevention for expenses
- Negative amount validation

### Data Flow
1. Categories created with monthly budgets
2. Expenses assigned to categories
3. Real-time budget calculations
4. Dashboard aggregation and visualization
5. Progress tracking with visual indicators

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive unit tests for contexts and schemas
- LiveView integration tests for user interactions
- Edge case testing for validations and calculations
- 44 total tests covering all major functionality

## Performance Optimizations
- Phoenix Streams for efficient DOM updates
- Preloaded associations to reduce N+1 queries
- Optimized database queries for spending calculations
- JavaScript hooks for smooth animations without blocking

## Security Considerations
- CSRF protection enabled
- Input sanitization through Ecto changesets
- Validation at both client and server levels
- No exposure of sensitive data in client-side code

## Development Workflow
1. Database migrations for schema changes
2. Context functions for business logic
3. LiveView modules for user interface
4. Template updates for visual changes
5. Test coverage for new functionality
6. JavaScript hooks for enhanced interactions

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Export functionality for expense reports
- Multi-currency support
- Recurring expense tracking
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app companion
- Expense receipt upload and OCR
